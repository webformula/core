<h6 class="page-secondary-header">About</h6>
<div class="mdw-font-body-large"> 
  Browsers, javascript, css, and html provide a robust set of features these days. With the addition of a couple of
  features like routing,
  we can build small performant applications without a steep learning curve. Webformula core provides the tools to
  achieve this in a tiny package (2KB). You can create your web application and decide weather to build it as a single page app or server it.
